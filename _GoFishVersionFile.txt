## Version 7.0.34 - 2024-05-29

- Fixed bug (#231) related to file templates on "Advanced" screen (again).  Related changes:

    - If you use '*' as the extension, GF may be bogged down searching files not of interest (such as text files created from binaries, or bak files).

    - Elapsed time was not including time to save results.
